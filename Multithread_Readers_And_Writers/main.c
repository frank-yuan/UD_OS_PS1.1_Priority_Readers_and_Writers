 Priority Readers and Writers
 
 Write a multi-threaded C program that gives readers priority over writers concerning a shared (global) variable. Essentially, if any readers are waiting, then they have priority over writer threads -- writers can only write when there are no readers. This program should adhere to the following constraints:
 
 Multiple readers/writers must be supported (5 of each is fine)
 Readers must read the shared variable X number of times
 Writers must write the shared variable X number of times
 
 Readers must print:
 The value read
 The number of readers present when value is read
 
 Writers must print:
 The written value
 The number of readers present were when value is written (should be 0)
 
 Before a reader/writer attempts to access the shared variable it should wait some random amount of time
 Note: This will help ensure that reads and writes do not occur all at once
 Use pthreads, mutexes, and condition variables to synchronize access to the shared variable
